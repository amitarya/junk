1) To build project use make.

bash$ make

Notes: For a debug build please use.

bash$ make DFLAGS="-ggdb -DDEBUG"

As a debugging feature I have added
the TLVObject::Dump to dump the in-memory
state of TLVObjects helping us in debugging.

2) To use the utility

bash$ ./imageConverter <input binary file> <output file>

For Eg.

./imageConverter TestInputs/TestInput1.binimage /tmp/TestInput1.pixmap
